## Pre Requirements
You need to have node.js and npm installed in you system.

## Starting the Application
Navigate to `src` directory and run the following commands to make everything available
    
    npm install
    bower install
    gulp
    
These commands will install node modules, bower components and run the default gulp task which will make everything ready. You can now host the `src` directory with your favourite HTTP server. My favourite is [node http-server](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server)
